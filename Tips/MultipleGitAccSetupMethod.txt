(1) First make sure your current directory is your .ssh folder.
Syntax for generating unique ssh key for ann account is:

		$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "h1y1b8s1@gmail.com" -f "github-H1Y1B8S1"

2) start SSH Agent and Add SSH keys for all accounts.

		$ eval `ssh-agent -s`

		$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-H1Y1B8S1

3) Add SSH public key to the Github
	Paste the public key on Github
	Sign in to Github Account
	Goto Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key
	Paste your copied public key and give it a Title of your choice.

4) Create a Config File and Make Host Entries
	If config file not already exists then create one (make sure you are in ~/.ssh directory)

		$ touch config

5) Now we need to add these lines to the file, each block corresponding to each account we created earlier.

     #office account
     Host github.com-SiddharthsinhDodiya
          HostName github.com
          User git
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-SiddharthsinhDodiya

     #personal account
     Host github.com-H1Y1B8S1
          HostName github.com
          User git
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-H1Y1B8S1


6) Cloning GitHub repositories using different accounts

 git clone git@github.com-{your-username}:{owner-user-name}/{the-repo-name}.git

 [e.g.]         $ git clone git@github.com-H1Y1B8S1:H1Y1B8S1/Cpp.git



Thats all.
